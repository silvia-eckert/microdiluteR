\description{
A list of six sample data sets with absorption values from broth
microdilution assays on 96-well plates, applied to two groups with one experiment
each at two time points T0 and T3.
}
\details{
The data was derived from two broth microdilution assay experiments testing the
growth performance of \emph{Botrytis cinerea} conidia on two \emph{Tanacetum vulgare}
chemotypes (defined as \code{groups}). Leaf extracts from chemotypes were fractionated using
solid-phase extraction with a water-methanol polarity gradient (defined as \code{treatment})
and fractions were subjected to assays in two concentrations (100 ppm and 200 ppm) plus
a positive control for each concentration level. The 96-well plate design was assigned in
horizontal direction (provided as \code{plate_axis}) and is stored in the metadata attribute
of the list. The data was generated for teaching purposes and is unrestricted by any
licensing constraints.
